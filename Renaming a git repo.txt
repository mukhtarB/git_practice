git branch -m old_branch new_branch         # Rename branch locally    
git push origin :old_branch                 # Delete the old branch    
git push --set-upstream origin new_branch   # Push the new branch, set local branch to track the new remote

** Remember to pull before! Or you may lose every commit not yet on your local branch

** For some reason my version of git (v2.3.2 on osx) keeps reusing the same remote branch name whether using --set-upstream or -u.
You could of course edit the gitconfig file but if this is happening to you, try using git branch --unset-upstream before doing the final push.

-------------
More effectively: espsecially for when u have only one branch
Rename on git hub --and then:

git branch -m old_name new_name
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/new_name new_name
git remote set-head origin -a
